				The computer is the data-based electronic machine initially invented by Charles Babbage back in 1837. He is called the “Father of computer”. 
				With the computer’s discovery, man has entered a new period of improvement. In this modern era, lives would be impossible without owning a 
				computer. A computer provides us with a wide range of possibilities, and there is an infinite number of things that can be done with the help 
				of a computer.
